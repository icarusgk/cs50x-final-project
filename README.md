# CS50x Final Project

The repository for [CS50x's final project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/project/)

## Getting Started

Creating an entire project may seem daunting. Here are some questions that you should think about as you start:

- What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
- What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
- If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
- In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?

Consider making goal milestones to keep you on track.

If using the CS50 Codespace, create a directory called ~/project to store your project source code and other files. You are welcome to develop your project outside of the CS50 Codespace.
